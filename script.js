// ## (If time): Spicy Thought Provoking Questions:

// 1. Take a look at the HTML (scroll down!) How do you think you were able to make the JavaScript interact with the HTML?

// 2. What would happen if you have put the number values you assigned in quotes? (Try it out and see!)

// 3. What do you think `document.querySelector()` is doing? (Hint: look at what's in the parenthesis following it).

// 4. What do you think .innerHTML is doing?
